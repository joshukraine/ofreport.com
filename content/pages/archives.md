Since 2003, we have published a newsletter called *Overseas Field Report*. If you're interested in reading the history of our ministry overseas, you've come to the right place!

God has been – and remains today – our faithful Shepherd: guiding our steps, providing for our needs, and demonstrating His power in ways that continue to astonish and bless us. We hope that our story will encourage you to place your complete trust in Him. He is faithful!

*"O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him."  (Psalms 34:8)*
