Bible First is an evangelistic correspondence course designed to reach unbelievers by involving them in a chronological study of the book of Genesis. Over the course of 20 lessons, students are presented not only with the Gospel, but every major doctrine in Scripture. The lessons point to Jesus, drawing on the types and parallels that God Himself built into Genesis.
