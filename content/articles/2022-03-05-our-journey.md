  As we crest the last hill, we finally see the crossing area come into view. What a welcome sight!

  On March 1, 2022, our family completed our crossing from Ukraine into Slovakia. This has been a difficult journey, but as always, God has been more than faithful. Itâ€™s been a few days since we posted news of our progress, so in this (admittedly longer) audio update, weâ€™d like to bring you up to speed. Weâ€™ll talk not only about what has transpired, but about our current position in Slovakia and our plans the future. Thanks for listening!
