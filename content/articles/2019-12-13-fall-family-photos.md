  We still don't have a new "official" family photo since Mia's arrival, but this impromptu shot in the living room turned out pretty nicely! Clockwise from the top: Joshua, Kelsie, Mia (4 mos.), Rebekah (11), Abigail (14), Macie (dog), Hosanna (9), David (2), Kathryn (4).

It's true, fall is nearly over. All the more reason to share some of the photos we've snapped over the past couple of months! We'll have a newsletter coming out soon, but in the meantime, here are a handful of memories from our life in L'viv.

As always, we're grateful for your prayers and support as we minister!
