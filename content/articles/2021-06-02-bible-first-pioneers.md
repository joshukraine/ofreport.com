For some of our readers, the launch of the Bible First Pioneers project may already be old news. That being said, we’ve yet to write about it here in our newsletter because of all the recent upheaval in our schedule. Additionally, the Pioneers project has grown in the months since it was launched, and we’re excited to tell you what’s new!

If you’ve been following our ministry, you’ve heard us talk about our work developing a web application called [Bible First Online](https://biblefirst.online/). The Pioneers project was originally conceived as a way to test drive the app with real-world users beyond our own Ukrainian student base.

We received much greater initial response than expected, and the project is now evolving into something of a coach-training program. Of course, our long-term vision is to open this application to missionaries and churches for use in evangelism. As we continue to iron out some of the wrinkles, the Pioneers project is giving people an opportunity to learn the software and get a feel for what it’s like to reach people for Christ through a digital correspondence course.

In recent weeks, we’ve also opened up the Pioneers program to our Ukrainian *Bible First* graduates. We’ve now begun Zoom training sessions for Ukrainian coaches, and God is blessing our efforts! Please pray for this ministry, and if you’d like to try it out yourself, be sure to let us know!

## Intimacy in Marriage Seminar

God continues to bring opportunities for Kelsie and I to speak to Ukrainian groups about marriage and family. Recently, we held a mini-seminar on the topic of intimacy in marriage. The event was organized by our friends at God’s Design Church here in L’viv. It was our first time to speak publicly on the topic, and it gave us the opportunity to develop some new material!

## How You Can Pray

* Pray that God would bless and grow our Pioneers project, both in the U.S. and in Ukraine.
* Pray that CMO 2022 would happen! This year’s project was [canceled due to COVID](https://euroteamoutreach.org/blog/2021/03/cmo-in-a-covid-world/).
* Pray for courage, grace, and wisdom as we raise our family and minister the Gospel here in L’viv.
* Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine.
