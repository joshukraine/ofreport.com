  Our family is moving to a house! The small apartment that has been our home for the past three months has been a God-send, but now it’s time for a bit more space. Additionally, we would like to bring you some new updates on the *Good and Evil* project, our other ETO team members, the *Bible First* program, and our recent family ministry trip to Bratislava.

Our family is moving to a house! The small apartment that has been our home for the past three months has been a God-send, but now it’s time for a bit more space. Additionally, we would like to bring you some new updates on the *Good and Evil* project, our other ETO team members, the *Bible First* program, and our recent family ministry trip to Bratislava.

Thank you so much for listening to our podcast! Please [share this episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-to-ukraine/id1613710582) with your friends, and pray for our family as we continue ministering to Ukrainians in Eastern Europe.

### How You Can Pray

- Pray that God would bless our move to the new house!
- Pray that our fingerprints would be accepted at the FBI and that we would be able to get Slovak residency soon.
- Continue to pray for the printing of the Ukrainian Freedom Edition of *Good and Evil*. We expect the presses to begin rolling this week! Pray for a quality print, for good storage and shipping options, and for an effective network of volunteers to help us with distribution.
- Pray for our ETO team as different ones find themselves spread across the globe. Pray that each of us would be faithful to share Christ with those around us.
- Pray for the development and reach of our *Bible First* program. Despite the onset of war in Ukraine, *Bible First* remains one of our core ministries, and we are eager for even more people to begin studying the Bible during these difficult times.
- Pray that God would continue to bless, strengthen, encourage, and guide our family as we navigate these uncertain times. He is faithful!
- Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine. 💙💛
