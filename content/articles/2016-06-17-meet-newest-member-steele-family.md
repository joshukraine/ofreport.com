Today we are excited to announce that we are expecting a new addition to our family! This week, we had our first ultrasound, and came home with our first photo. Kelsie is about eleven weeks along, and so far everything is looking great. Based on the ultrasound data, our projected due date is January 4, 2017.

Kelsie has struggled with the typical morning sickness and fatigue, and is grateful to be nearing the end of the first trimester. Already she is starting to feel better.

We are grateful to God for entrusting us with another of His little ones!
