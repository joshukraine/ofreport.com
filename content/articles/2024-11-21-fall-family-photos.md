If you’ve been following my
[Facebook updates](https://www.facebook.com/1040006553/videos/3854627231471825/)
this month, you know we’ve had some exciting days of ministry in central and
southern Ukraine. I’m working on a more detailed report about all that, but in
the meantime, I thought I’d share something a bit lighter: our latest family

Abigail visited us in October, so we decided to take some new family photos in a
nearby park. We were so happy with how they turned out, and it reminded us again
of how blessed we are to have a family. God is good!
