Why is Russia acting as it is? What are the fundamental motivators driving their campaign of evil against Ukraine? In this episode, we’ll talk about the fascinating world of geopolitics and its relevance to the current conflict. We’ll also bring you up to date on our family news, the *Good and Evil* project, and our *Bible First* ministry.

Thank you so much for listening to our podcast! Please [share this episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-to-ukraine/id1613710582) with your friends, and pray for our family as we continue ministering to Ukrainians in Eastern Europe.

### How You Can Pray

- Praise the Lord for the provision of a house for our family during our stay in Slovakia.
- Pray for those affected by the attack in Vinnytsia and for so many other Ukrainian families that are suffering due to Russian aggression.
- Pray for a speedy end to the war and a decisive Ukrainian victory.
- Praise the Lord for good progress with the *Good and Evil* and *Bible First* ministries. Pray for continued blessing and fruit as we seek to share Christ with Ukrainians in Eastern Europe.
- Praise the Lord the successful FBI background checks! Pray that we will be able to get hard copies of those documents (with apostilles!) over here to Slovakia very soon.
- Pray for health for our family and the community here, especially as COVID is again on the rise.
- Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine. 💙💛
