Happily, it appears that this journey of peaks and valleys is nevertheless leading us in a generally upward direction. Yesterday, our attorney finally received the documents needed in order for us to apply for our new visas at the Ukrainian consulate in Poland. While the battle is far from over, this latest development is certainly encouraging.

On March 13, our entire team minus the Day family (who are in America) will appear at the Ukrainian consulate in Krakow where we will present our documents. All indicators point to a positive outcome and we are optimistic that we will receive our visas that same day.

Then the real battle begins. From that point, we will have 45 days to complete the registration process with our local OVIR in L'viv. While that may sound straightforward, experience has shown it to be anything but. We are grateful to have a good attorney as well as the experience of a few missionaries who have gone before us.

As always, we appreciate your continued intercession for our family and our ministry as we strive to make Christ known in Ukraine.
