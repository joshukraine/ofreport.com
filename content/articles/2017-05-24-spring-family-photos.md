Spring is here! And that means family photos. :) Our little David Noble is now 4 months old, and until now he's been conspicuously absent from our main family portrait. Time to fix that!

The weather these days in L'viv has been gorgeous. Spring has undoubtedly sprung, and the greenery is everywhere. Last week, we planned a picnic at a large park here in the city called [Stryis'kyi Park](https://goo.gl/maps/VtZdwLKBaaw). Despite its location, once you enter the park you would never guess that you're in a city.

What could be more fun that a picnic in the park on a sunny day? :)

In addition to the lovely weather, we were also blessed to have Bohdana with us. (She's the young lady who comes to our home a few times a week to help Kelsie.) During the photo shoot, she stood behind the camera and kept the attention of the little ones. You can thank her for the cheery smiles!

We hope you enjoy the pictures. God has blessed our family with five precious children, and we couldn't be more grateful!
