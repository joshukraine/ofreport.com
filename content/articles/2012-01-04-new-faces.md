Our English Club seems to be growing of late. For the past several weeks, we've seen a marked increase in attendance, and at times have even had to worry a bit about seating!

Our English Club has been meeting for over three years now, and in that time we've built some key relationships with Ukrainians who come regularly. Below are some photos from yesterday's meeting. Thanks for praying for this ministry!

We've also begun bringing Abby and Beka. They love coming to English Club with Dad, coloring on the white board, playing with the other kids (after the meeting) and of course eating cookies during the fellowship time.

Please keep praying for our English Club. Of course, our primary goal is not English, but to communicate Christ to these precious souls. We do this often by reading together from Good and Evil (by No Greater Joy), but also in conversation and through Bible teaching. While some members of our group are saved, many others are not. Regardless, we have good rapport with the whole group and it is our desire to see each of them turn to Jesus for salvation.
