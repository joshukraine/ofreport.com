Couples then exchanged one of their shoes with their spouse, leaving every person holding “his” and “her” shoes. The moderator would ask questions of the group like “Who takes more time in the shower?” or “Who is usually first to apologize?” To answer, you raise his or her shoe. Couples whose answers agreed got a point for that round. It was fun to see how closely the answers aligned!" />
