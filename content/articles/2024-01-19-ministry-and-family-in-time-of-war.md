There are days when things appear almost peaceful. We move about the city,
living what seems a normal life, and we almost forget that there’s a war on.
Then the sirens go off again, reminding us why we pray for peace and liberty in
Ukraine.

Thankfully, L’viv remains one of the safer areas of Ukraine right now, and God
has been faithful to protect our lives and property. We have lost so little
compared to many, and the Lord continues to guide and bless us. In this
(admittedly overdue) report, we’d like to share with you a glimpse into our
family and ministry in this difficult time of war.

## Fall Marriage Retreat

In January of 2023, while we were still in Slovakia, our church from L’viv
contacted us with a request: would Kelsie and I travel back into Ukraine to lead
a marriage seminar? We agreed, and preparations began in earnest.

Then, just a few weeks before the seminar was scheduled, rumors began to swirl
of a new invasion from Belorussian territory, which is only a few hundred
kilometers north of L’viv. People were suddenly forced anew to make decisions
about whether or not to flee the country in the face of foreign aggression. It
was decided that, given this new looming threat, now was not the time to gather
for a seminar, and the event was canceled.

In the end, the northern invasion never materialized, and today, it seems highly
unlikely that the Russians will be able to mount any kind of ground invasion
from the north for the foreseeable future.

Several months passed, and as you likely know already, our family made the
decision to return to Ukraine. We’ve been here now for over six months, and for
the record, we are more confident than ever that coming home to Ukraine was the
right choice.

Time passed, and the wife of one of our pastors approached us again about the
possibility of revisiting the marriage seminar. This time it would be a couples
retreat in the Carpathian Mountains, just a few hours south of L’viv. We again
agreed, and again began to prepare.

The event was held in November, and while the focus was on couples, we all
brought our kiddos as well. God blessed, and we had a warm and memorable time of
fellowship, teaching, games, and even Ukrainian barbecue!

Preparing for the event posed an interesting challenge for Kelsie and me. For
one thing, many of the couples in our church have been married for as long or
longer than we have. These are not marriage newbies, and many of them could
teach a marriage seminar themselves! There were also some younger couples, as
well as some wives who attended alone. One such was a woman named Nadia, who
ministered with our team this summer. She came to the retreat alone because her
husband has been fighting the Russians since war broke out nearly two years ago.

With all these things in mind, we decided to take a slightly different approach
to our content. We based our presentation on a fantastic article entitled
[Seven Pearls for Finding a Happy Marriage](https://nogreaterjoy.org/articles/seven-pearls-for-finding-a-happy-marriage/),
written by none other than our own mentors, Michael and Debi Pearl.

As an aside, I remember being a single man and spending time with Mike and Debi.
As I watched the two of them interact, I was inspired. Their actions
demonstrated that they were not just spouses, but best friends. I said to
myself, “When I get married, that’s the kind of relationship I want to have with
my wife.”

Fast-forward nearly 20 years, and it was a privilege to be able to share some of
the Pearls’ wisdom with our church here. Of course, Kelsie and I mixed in plenty
of our own testimonies and thoughts, as well as wisdom we’ve gleaned from our
parents. Kelsie did a wonderful job planning some couples games, and these
turned out to be a real hit!

I think more than anything else, I was personally blessed to see these husbands
and wives together. One of our games called for couples to play as a team and
sort Skittles into bowls by color. The challenge was that they could only use
one hand each. With their other arm, they had to embrace their spouse. It was
silly and fun and everyone got a good laugh. But as I stood to the side,
watching these married friends of mine, I almost teared up. I was filled with
joy to see them embracing, to see them laughing, to see them together.

There are so many marriages ending in divorce, and this is a tragedy that
grieves not only my heart, but God’s. Today, more than ever before, I live by
the maxim that my mama taught me from the time I was a young boy: “Divorce is
not an option.” God grant us grace to forgive, to love, and to endure for His
glory.

Are you married? Go hug your spouse today, and tell them that you will never,
ever leave. _“What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”
(Mark 10:9)_

## Family Life

I sometimes look around at my family and think, “These are the golden years.” We
are together, we are safe, we are growing and learning and doing our best to
share Christ in the land of Ukraine.

Abigail continues to thrive in her new life in Houston. We don’t know how long
she’ll be there, but for this season, we believe this is God’s direction for
her.

Back in Ukraine, we now have one extra seat in the van! Our next eldest
daughters, Rebekah and Hosanna, are growing into lovely, very responsible young
ladies. I feel more like Potiphar all the time: I’m surrounded by competent
people who run my household better than I ever could!

Kathryn, David, and Mia (“the Littles”) are getting bigger all the time. Mia,
our youngest, is now four, and we are reminded to savor every moment of these
tender years. Truly children are His heritage.

## Good and Evil Outreach

One of our core ministries continues to be our _Good and Evil_ distribution
program. As of this writing, we have over 80 registered distributors working to
get the _Good and Evil_ book into the hands of Ukrainians. Some of our
distributors are quite active, coming back to us again and again for resupply.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, we have given away over 11,000
copies of _Good and Evil_. Often, our distributors send us pictures of their
work, and we’ve included some highlights below.

## How You Can Pray

  He would continue to strengthen marriages in our church and yours.
- Pray that God would continue to open doors for us to preach the Gospel through
  avenues such as the _Good and Evil_ program, Bible First Online, and others.
- Pray for our teammates, the Day family, who are returning to Ukraine on March
  1! We are super excited to have them back!
- Pray for health, wisdom and courage for our family.

Couples were seated back-to-back, and everyone had to remove their shoes. Couples then exchanged one of their shoes with their spouse, leaving every person holding “his” and “her” shoes. The moderator would ask questions of the group like “Who takes more time in the shower?” or “Who is usually first to apologize?” To answer, you raise his or her shoe. Couples whose answers agreed got a point for that round. It was fun to see how closely the answers aligned!" />
