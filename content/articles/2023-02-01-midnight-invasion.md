## How You Can Pray

* Pray for resilience and strength for Ukrainians as they continue to battle Russia’s invasion of their homeland.
* Pray that God would continue to bless and prosper our various Gospel outreaches, including Bible First, the *Good and Evil* book, and possibly even a return of CMO in 2023! 😮
* Pray for safety for me as I prepare for yet another trip to Ukraine on February 8.
* Pray for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as millions continue to struggle with power outages, lack of heat, poor Internet and phone access, and other hardships during the winter months.
* Pray for health, wisdom and courage for our family.
* Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine.
