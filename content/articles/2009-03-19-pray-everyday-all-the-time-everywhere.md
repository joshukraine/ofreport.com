In Ukraine, it is not uncommon to find people who think that prayer must be read from a book or recited from an already assembled collection. Many people often pray the Lord's prayer in a repetitious fashion, but have little idea of telling their hearts to God. The simplicity of coming to God as a Father and asking for what you need, or offering thanksgiving and worship, is sometimes foreign to them. READMORE

Jessie did a wonderful job of explaining to our Tuesday night group what the Bible says about prayer. He touched on what, where, when, why, and how to pray. We all came away encouraged to "pray everyday, all the time, everywhere."

Denise gave me a needed break by planning English Club for the next two weeks. She is offering some fresh perspective and good ideas. It has been great having both her and Bryan join our team.

Joshua and Jessie have known each other for about 13 years and have actively worked together for 8. Spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ together has been a major part of their friendship.

We appreciate all the prayers that are going up on behalf of this ministry! Our request is not only that the people attending would come to know Christ as their personal Savior, but also that the CD recordings of the preaching and Bible teaching will reach countless others who we may never even meet.
