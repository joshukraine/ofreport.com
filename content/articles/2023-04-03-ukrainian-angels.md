  This interview is long overdue for publishing, but today it’s finally ready. In this episode, we take you once again to the small Ukrainian town of Radekhiv — this time for an interview with the director of the “Hostesses of Radekhiv”, Milena Slyusarchuk. You’ll be sobered, inspired, and I hope challenged by Milena’s story. Listen as she shares her firsthand experiences bringing aid to soldiers on the front lines of Ukraine’s war against Russian tyranny.
