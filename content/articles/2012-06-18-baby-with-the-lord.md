For the past week or so, Kelsie has not felt any movement from the baby. Today, we went in for an ultrasound which confirmed what we were beginning to suspect: our baby has gone home.

While this news was difficult to receive, we are relieved that closure is near. God has made clear His choice to take our child to be with Him, and we have complete peace with that decision. Even now, we know that nothing is impossible with God, and we continue to trust His guidance.

In the meantime, we ask that you continue to pray for our family. The delivery will likely occur soon. Pray for Kelsie's safety, for wisdom as we face many medical decisions, and for healing for our family.

We would like to express our sincere gratefulness to all of you who have prayed, given, conducted research, provided housing and childcare, and helped in other ways. We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of believers everywhere who have demonstrated the hallmark of God's true church: love one for another.

More updates will be forthcoming, but for now, please be assured that we are well. God has given us much grace and comfort during this time, and we are continually reminded that, as Romans 8:18 assures us, this present sorrow is not worthy to be compared with the glory that awaits us.

*"The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him." (Psalm 34:8)*
