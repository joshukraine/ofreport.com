After many weeks of legal consultations, prepping documents, and praying, we have our visas. A huge thank-you goes out to all of you who have been praying with us about this need. And while today is definitely a big step in the right direction, there are many more steps ahead.

The visas we received today at the Ukrainian consulate mark the beginning of a 45-day window, during which we will need to complete our registration process in L'viv. We have known some missionaries who literally needed every one of those 45 days in order to do this. We'll be posting more updates as we have them, but in the meantime please don't stop praying! God is for us and we have learned through many joyful experiences that He can open any door.
