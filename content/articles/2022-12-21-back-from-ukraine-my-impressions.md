I went to Ukraine and made it back in one piece! It was my first time there in six months. In this episode, I share my impressions from several days spent in L’viv as well as a possible answer to that looming question: “Can we return to Ukraine?”

Thank you so much for listening to our podcast! Please [share this episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/journey-to-ukraine/id1613710582) with your friends, and pray for our family as we continue ministering to Ukrainians in Eastern Europe.

## How You Can Pray
* Praise the Lord for a successful trip to Ukraine on December 3–8.

* Pray for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as millions face a long, cold winter with limited access to heat and electricity.
* Pray for our Ukrainian Family Fellowship in Žilina.
* Pray for health, wisdom and courage for our family.
* Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine.
