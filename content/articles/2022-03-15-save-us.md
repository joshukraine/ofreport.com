A few days ago, I received a sobering text message which consisted of only two words: “Save us”. That message was sent by someone trapped in the city of Chernihiv, currently besieged by the Russian invaders.

In this latest update, we’ll talk more about the evacuation work that’s going on in Ukraine. You’ll also hear about our search for a new van, how our family is getting on in Slovakia, and about specific ways that you can continue supporting us in prayer.

And lastly, we’re very excited to announce the launch of our new podcast, <nuxt-link to="/podcast">*Journey to Ukraine*</nuxt-link>. We would also like to extend our sincere thanks to two amazing people that helped us get this podcast on its feet. Andrew Hale designed the artwork for the podcast, while my very own brother Jonathan Steele selected the music and did the editing/mastering for our intro. Both of these fine gentlemen donated their time and talents at no cost to us. Thank you guys for your generosity!
