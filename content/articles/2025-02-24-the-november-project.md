  Late in 2024, our team had the incredible privilege of traveling to some of
  the areas in Ukraine hardest hit by the war. Amidst minefields and bombed-out
  homes, we spoke with people who have endured unimaginable loss. The image
  above was taken on the final day of our trip when we had the opportunity to
  preach the Gospel and distribute aid to a large group of Ukrainians in the
  city of Zhytomyr.

  It all began with a phone call from Ben Sargent. Ben serves on our board of
  directors with Euro Team Outreach, and for some time, we‚Äôd been planning for
  him to visit Ukraine. The goal had been to brainstorm and plan future ministry
  projects. But now Ben had a new idea. ‚ÄúJosh, when I get there, I want you to
  find me an interpreter and a vehicle to take me close to the front so I can
  preach the Gospel. I don‚Äôt care if something happens to me; I‚Äôm ready to go!‚Äù
  That‚Äôs one reason we‚Äôre so blessed to have Ben on our team. His enthusiasm and
  vision keep us going! As we spoke on the phone, I thought fast and made a few
  suggestions. After our conversation ended, I knew who I needed to call:
  Oleksandr Ilchenko.

Oleksandr is a Ukrainian missionary‚Äîalso a husband and father of seven‚Äîwhom we
initially met through our _Good and Evil_ program. Like Ben, Oleksandr has
energy and boldness. Soon, I had him on the phone, and we began planning.

Ben departed for Krakow, Poland, on November 1, but due to flight complications,
he didn‚Äôt arrive until late Sunday night, November 3. We met at a local hotel,
and the following morning, we drove to Ukraine as quickly as possible. We
stopped in L‚Äôviv to pack gear and pick up Nathan Day, then hit the road again.

Our next destination was Zhytomyr, where Oleksandr lives and pastors a small
church. He had arranged for us to load the van with supplies before heading
southeast to Mykolaiv and Kherson. Our goal was to bring humanitarian aid and
preach the Gospel.

Prior to the trip, we coordinated with Oleksandr to assemble 500 humanitarian
aid boxes containing staples like flour, oil, beans, and pickled meat.
Additionally, he arranged for fresh bread to be baked at various points along
our route, which we would distribute with the aid boxes.

The road to Mykolaiv and Kherson was long and rough. We had removed most of the
van‚Äôs seats to maximize cargo space, stuffing it to capacity with aid boxes and
bread. We crawled over rocky, unpaved roads, flanked by fields littered with
burned-out cars and tanks. Everything was mined, and warning signs lined the
road. Death was all around us.

Our first meeting was in New Odesa, just north of Mykolaiv. A large crowd had
gathered thanks to Oleksandr‚Äôs advance planning. Ben preached the Gospel while I
translated, and every Ukrainian in attendance received an aid package. Many also
took home copies of _Good and Evil_.

The next day, we were up early, driving to another village. Then another. We
crossed from Mykolaiv into Kherson oblast, drawing ever closer to
Russian-occupied territory. Each stop revealed the same scenes: open fields
filled with mines, long dirt roads, bombed-out buildings, and twisted remnants
of Russian weapons. And in every location, we shared the message of salvation in
Jesus with the people we met. Yes, they may have come primarily for the bread
and staples we offered‚Äîand I was amazed by how eager they were for these small
gifts. But they departed not only with freshly baked bread to nourish their
bodies but having heard of the Bread of Life.

With our circuit of towns complete, we began the long journey back to Zhytomyr.
There, we assisted Oleksandr‚Äôs church team with a large Gospel meeting. Dozens
of refugees came to receive aid.

Looking back, I feel small writing these words. So much remains to be done, and
so many still need help. Most of all, they need Him. Whatever happens to
Ukraine‚Äîand we pray daily for complete victory and liberation‚Äîeternity is what
truly matters.

I have often said that, were it left up to me, I would happily spend the rest of
my days in this beautiful country of Ukraine, ministering the Gospel to
Ukrainians and speaking their language. But more than anything, I long to see
these precious people in heaven. To that end, I will continue laboring as long
as God gives me breath.
