Today Kelsie and our three girls departed L'viv accompanied by my mom, Cathy. They have about 18 hours of travel ahead of them before arriving in Houston where they will be met by the Powells, Kelsie's parents. Happily, there were no problems at all when they passed through customs. What a blessing!

My mom has been with our family in Ukraine for almost three weeks now and her help has been invaluable! We had initially planned to send Kelsie and the girls alone to the US, but God, knowing our current circumstances, provided a much better alternative. Mom, thanks so much for all you've done. We love you!

On a more somber note, Kelsie and I went back to our clinic yesterday for one final ultrasound. The results indicate that the condition of our baby has worsened significantly. The hygroma is now actually larger than the baby itself, and vital signs are continuing to weaken. While we welcome supernatural intervention from the Lord – and are certainly praying towards that end – all evidence indicates that our youngest will soon be going home.

Please continue to pray for our family. The days ahead will not be easy, but God has given us the peace that passes our human understanding. Years of walking with our Savior have taught us that we do not need to know all the reasons behind each trial, or the final outcome of the path we walk. We know our God and that is enough. We are fully persuaded that God is good, that God is faithful, and we rejoice in the confidence that His presence is more precious than even our physical lives. Surely no more joyful destiny could be imagined for our little one than to be safe in the place that we ourselves long for: the house of our Father.

**"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple."<br>Psalm 27:4**
