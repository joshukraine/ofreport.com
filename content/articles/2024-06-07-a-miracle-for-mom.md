Just over one month ago, I was begging God for a day—even half a day or just a
few hours—a chance to see my mom again before she passed into eternity. On the
morning of May 1, as our family prepared to board a plane in Vienna bound for
the US, Mom’s heart still beat, albeit weakly.

International flights usually offer in-flight wifi, and this time, I planned to
pay for it. I couldn’t bear the thought of being off-grid when the end came. If
we couldn’t make it in time, a video call was the next best option to say
goodbye.

...

In the days leading up to our trip, I prayed and asked God for fifteen more
years of life for Mom. My faith was weak, but I clung to the knowledge that He
is strong, He is able, He is good, and with Him, nothing is impossible. I still
don’t know God’s final plan for Mom’s life or whether He will give her the
fifteen years. But as I reflect on all He has done for Mom and our family, I’m
beginning to wish I had asked for thirty.

## How You Can Pray

- Pray that God would heal Mom and give her more years of life with us. I'm
  praying for 15. It worked for Hezekiah! 😁🙏
- Pray for our family as we travel by van across four countries just to reach
  our departure airport. (Ukraine &rarr; Poland &rarr; Slovakia &rarr; Austria)
  We fly out of Vienna on Wednesday morning.
- Pray for our children as they adjust to a new culture and new experiences, not
  to mention fighting jet lag.
- Praise God for the many generous saints who have already stepped up to help
  our family with logistics like housing and a vehicle. We are so grateful for
  the body of Christ!
- Praise God for our friend Matej in Slovakia who has offered to park our blue
  van free for the entire time we are in the States!
