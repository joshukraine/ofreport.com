I am told that most young ladies receive a pleasant sort of shock when they learn of a secret admirer. Kelsie was no exception. She, too, had experienced some disappointments before meeting me and had wondered if a man of godly character would ever pursue her.

Now, as her father handed over the rolled up parchment, she loosened the ribbon and read my invitation.

*Dear Kelsie,*

*Although you do not know me, I have been corresponding with your parents for the past month or so in regards to a possible courtship with you. I have really enjoyed getting to know them, and in a way getting to know you through them…*

*…we have been “talking about you” for some time now, and your mother and father wrote me recently, saying that they felt this would be a good time to let you know about all of this.*

*And so my purpose in writing you this letter, is to see if you would be willing to begin a courtship relationship, with the goal of marriage in mind should the Lord so direct us.*

Kelsie’s immediate response was to get alone and pray. She had my letter, the Ukrainian phrasebook, and a stack of missionary newsletters that I had written over the past two and a half years.

As Kelsie prayed, the rest of us held our breaths and waited. Happily, we did not have to wait long. A few hours later I received Kelsie’s response in which she excitedly agreed to begin a relationship!
