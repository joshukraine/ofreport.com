  Yura and his two sons, Matviy (left) and Marko (right) visited our home on February 24, 2022 — the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The visit had been planned days earlier, and we decided to go ahead with it. We shared a meal, played games, swapped stories, and enjoyed fellowship despite the onset of war.
