Yep, we're still here! Why? Just Google the terms "<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=iceland+volcano" target="_blank">Iceland volcano</a>" and you'll find a whole pile of news stories covering the most recent act of God which has paralyzed European air travel. Bottom line: our original flight to Ukraine was cancelled, and we have been rebooked for April 27th, ash-cloud permitting. Please pray that God would remove this ash cloud and that we would have safe flying conditions for our return to L'viv. Traveling with us on the same day will be Bryan Shufelt.

### House Update

As many of you know, the Lord provided last year for Kelsie and I to purchase our first house in the US. With the help of many dear saints, we've been able to complete all the repairs, and the house is now ready for leasing. Please pray with us that God would bring along just the right tenants. Below are a few pictures of the house since the remodeling.

### Visa Problems

Remember a few months ago when we told you about some immigration snags that were part of our original reasons for coming to the US? Well, Ukraine is at it again! Just in the last week or two, we've learned that the local immigration authorities have decided that they will no longer register cultural visas. Most of the missionaries we know in Ukraine (including us) have this type of visa, so obviously this new restriction poses a significant problem. Without registration, you can only stay in the country for 90 days regardless of the term of your visa. We are currently pursuing some various solutions, but don't yet have anything definite. It looks like we may have to get new visas of a different type. This may be a solution, but it's very expensive. (~$300 per visa per person!) Please pray that God would work this out and that missionaries would be able to remain in Ukraine, preaching the Gospel openly.

### Hank Thompson

Speaking of preaching, we recently had the honor of hosting Hank Thompson and his family at our house in Fort Worth. Hank and his wife Amy are just back from Thailand and are speaking and preaching at various locations in the US. Also traveling with the Thompsons are the Murphy's. Like Hank, Bryce Murphy is a street preacher. Bryce, Hank, myself and a couple of other men went to downtown Fort Worth one night while they were here and preached the Gospel on the street corners for a couple of hours. I hadn't done that in a while, and even though my voice gave out quickly, it was wonderful to once again be proclaiming Christ in the "highways and hedges." I stand fully behind Hank's ministry, and I believe that God is using him in a powerful way to open the eyes of sinners to their need for the Lord Jesus. If you'd like to get a fresh dose of encouragement and vision for front-line evangelism, contact Hank about speaking at your church. You'll be glad you did! Here's how to contact Hank:
