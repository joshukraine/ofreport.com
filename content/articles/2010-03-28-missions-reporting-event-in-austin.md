<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">EVENT CANCELLED</span></strong></p>

Due to sickness in my family and also in the family that was organizing this event, we have decided to postpone it until a later date. If/when that is scheduled, we will post a new invitation. We apologize for the late notice.

I will be speaking in Austin, TX this coming Wednesday, March 31 at 7:00pm. I'll be showing our missions DVD, speaking about the ministry, and preaching a message on evangelism called "Vision, Strategy, Perseverance."

If you're in the area and you'd like to join us, please <a href="http://www.ofreport.com/contact/">contact me for details</a>.
