This past week, our team held a four-day English Club in the Carpathian town of Skole. (pronounced skó-leh) This outreach was actually begun by a Ukrainian friend of ours, Sergiy Chepara, who is native to Skole.

Every morning, Jessie, Denise and I made the 1.5 drive to Skole for the meetings which began at 11am. These usually lasted until 1:00 or so, after which we would drive back to L'viv. It was a rather tiring ordeal, but God certainly blessed.

After our last meeting on Thursday, the whole group went for a walk in the woods near Skole.

We had a wonderful group of enthusiastic students. Our main goal was to build relationships with them as well as with the school administrators, and all indicators point to a very successful outcome. As always, English is merely a door to greater things to come, and we would appreciate your prayers for Sergiy, for our team, and for the advancement of the Gospel among the Ukrainians in Skole.
