Five years ago, around Valentine's Day, my dad took me to a special restaurant for dinner. A looong discussion ensued regarding my future and what steps I should be taking. READMORE Together we decided that I should continue to wait at home for God's direction. I would continue serving in my local church, pursuing studies, and helping my family. Only two days following this conversation, Joshua wrote to my Dad for the first time, beginning a correspondence which would shortly result in our courtship and marriage.

I feel as if every Valentine's Day were the anniversary of the beginning of our story. How grateful I am to be five years into our relationship, so loved and cherished by the man who is so perfect for me. Marriage just keeps getting better! In celebration of the day, Joshua and I had made special plans to go rock climbing, something we really enjoy doing together.

These are bouldering walls, so we were only climbing a short way off the ground. The slanted walls force you to build arm strength.

Afterward we enjoyed coffee and lunch at a favorite cafe. It was the perfect place to stop in out of the constantly falling snow.

**Stay Tuned:** Over the next few weeks, we are planning to begin a series of posts on how God brought us together 5 years ago from opposite sides of the globe, without ever having even met each other!
