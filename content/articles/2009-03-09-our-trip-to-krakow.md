To everyone who prayed for our recent trip to Krakow - thank you! It went very well. I was able to get my visa, though not for as long a term as I had planned.

Kels and I had a wonderful time in Krakow as usual. For us, Krakow is a nice place to relax and take some time off from the daily grind of L'viv. Here are a few pictures from our trip. Thanks again for praying!

Because the tracks in Ukraine are a different gauge than the rest of Europe, they actually have to change the wheels on the entire train when we get to the border! This process can take up to four hours.
