  What a blessing to reunite with our dear friends from the church in L’viv! These ladies are heroes. In the midst of war and evacuation, they are faithfully sharing Christ with their fellow refugees in Poland!
preview: >
  As we enter the third month of Russia’s war against Ukraine, I am reminded of Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 16:9: *“For a **great door and effectual** is opened unto me, and there are **many adversaries**.”* Despite the sorrow and tragedy of war, God continues to lead and bless His people. In this episode, we’ll tell you all about our recent trip to Poland where we visited a large group of our displaced Ukrainian friends from our church in L’viv. We also have updates about a new printing of the *Good and Evil* Bible comic book, our ministry to Ukrainians in Slovakia and more.

*UPDATE: Since recording this episode, L’viv has again been hit by a Russian cruise missile attack. Preliminary reports indicate that 2–3 electrical substations were hit, and as I write this, multiple regions of the city are without power. Please continue to pray for peace and safety in Ukraine, and for a swift end to this terrible war!*
