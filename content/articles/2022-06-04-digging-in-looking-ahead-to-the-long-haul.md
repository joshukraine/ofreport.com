  It has now been over 100 days since Russia invaded our home — the beautiful country of Ukraine. We’re all ready for this nightmare to end, but reality is not as simple as we would like. In this episode, we’ll share our thinking about the long-term implications of the war for our family and ministry. We’ll update you on several key fronts, and we’ll close out the episode with an informative synopsis of the military situation on the ground in Ukraine.

### 💙💛 Radekhivski Hospodyni

Also in this episode, we talk more about the charity foundation “Radekhivski Hospodyni”. Their volunteers are working hard to send aid to soldiers on the front lines. They collate, package, and ship everything from food stuffs and medicines to shoes, clothing and even tactical gear. They’ve been in operation since 2014 when Russia first attacked Crimea and eastern Ukraine. If you’re curious, you can see photos of their work on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/404821584832741/posts/414083370573229/?__cft__[0]=AZXANY0QfpPgYa52ikQeW9qeM1rWbkym8QwGdkvA-tjVWKJ1gqARTqN7zjmRzUo8C6HwtIosM_woNBqrHCU55XO7Dn02mS7dWIsLBtUSGB9NlgEYKZDta091oRc2WD456i92qgsWY9H62jcsSSFbxl42i-BxDpBd_psG2nkyiXu9UA9qvl19mxndy5Ka3QVsZgsSHdfX6EXIEB_5CmDqRxDl&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R).

If you would like donate to Radekhivski Hospodyni, you can do so easily by sending funds via PayPal to Yura (Yuriy) Petriv. (details below) Yura is a member of our church in L’viv and a personal friend of more than 20 years.

Don’t forget to choose the “family and friends” option so that Yura will receive the full amount of your gift.

### How You Can Pray

- Pray for Serhii and Natallia and their children as they persevere through prolonged separation. Pray for Serhii as he finishes his training and heads to the front lines, likely in a couple of weeks.
- Pray for the upcoming printing of the 2022 Ukrainian Freedom Edition of *Good and Evil*. Pray for a quality print (no errors, regressions) followed by quick and efficient distribution to Ukrainians both in-country and abroad.
- Pray for speedy progress with our Slovakian residency.
- Praise the Lord for the provision of our new van! (Details coming soon in the next issue of Overseas Field Report.)
- Pray for continued health for our family. We’re all well at the moment, but we’d like it to stay that way! 🙂
- Pray that God would continue to open doors for our family to bless and minister to Ukrainians.
- Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine.
