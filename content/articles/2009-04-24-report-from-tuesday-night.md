Each Tuesday evening, we continue to meet together with Ukrainians for English Club and Audio Bible Study. (ABS)  "Audio" refers to the fact that each time Joshua, Jessie, or another missionary preaches from the Word of God, the messages are being recorded in digital format so that multiple Ukrainians can have access to them over time. READMORE Although the first half of the evening is a focus on English, the preaching time is always done in Ukrainian so that the nationals can hear the Word of God clearly  in their own language. This ministry continues to grow and we are encouraged by how God has blessed it! New people often visit our group, and others have become regular attendees. Thank you to everyone who is consistently lifting this ministry up in prayer. Please pray with us that it would bear fruit unto salvation, and that people would be "turned from the error of their way" unto Christ, who is THE way.
