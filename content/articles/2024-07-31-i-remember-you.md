  Every day I had with you was a gift — a treasure that can never be replaced.
  And yet, through my tears, I rejoice. I would not call you back if I could,
  for I know you are at rest in His presence.

_“Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.” (Psalms
116:15)_

Oh, Mom, how can it be that you are not here with me? I came home to Steele
Creek, to the home you built for us, but you were gone.

All these years we walked together, and you taught me, you corrected me, you
sang to me and held me. You loved me. You were the mother any son would dream to
have.

But now you have flown away, and I am left in sorrow. Mom, I grieve your
passing, and I miss you terribly. I struggle to bear the silence as I notice
your fingerprints all around me: the beauty and color you created in our family.

Every day I had with you was a gift — a treasure that can never be replaced. And
yet, through my tears, I rejoice. I would not call you back if I could, for I
know you are at rest in His presence.

Think of me today as you walk on Heaven’s paths. I cling to every memory of you
that I have. Let my heart never forget your wisdom, nor my ears your voice as I
await the day of our reunion.

You ran your race so well. In life, you served others with every ounce of
strength God gave you. Your life was light and joy to all who knew you. People
saw Jesus in you.

Mom, I love you. Thank you for loving me and pouring out yourself for me. I will
continue on the path you showed me. I will follow Jesus to the very end, as you
did, and then I, too, will fly away to where you are. And we will embrace, and
we will rejoice, and no tear will ever again escape our eyes.

_“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more
death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the
former things are passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)_
