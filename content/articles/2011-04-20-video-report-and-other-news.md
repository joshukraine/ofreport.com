Better late than never? I suppose the truth of that statement depends on the situation, but late as it may be, our *latest* ETO Video Report is online! Go ahead and check it out, then keep scrolling down for more news. And as always, thanks for keeping up with our ministry and praying for us!

### New OFR Available

The publication of our newsletter, Overseas Field Report, has admittedly fallen behind schedule. The main reason for this is that more and more of our reporting is now done online. At any rate, the latest PDF copy of Overseas Field Report has been mailed out to all our regular subscribers. If you haven't seen it yet, you can <a href="/archives">download it here</a>.

### Switching Skypes AGAIN?!

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the Steeles are at it again: switching around our online personalities just to keep you guessing. ;) Actually, the main problem is trying to establish consistent usernames for all (or most) of the online services we use. I won't bore you with the details, but generally Kelsie's online identity is "kelsiesteele" and mine is "joshukraine." For example, with Skype, Kelsie's account has returned to what it used to be: "kelsiesteele." Mine remains the same as it has been for a while: "joshukraine." If you still have our old "joshandkels" account in your list, go ahead and delete that. It's no longer active.

All the other stuff (e-mails, Twitter, etc.) remains the same as it was. Sorry for the confusion. We'll try not to change again anytime soon!

### Family Update

In short, all is well. Hosanna is growing fast and is a healthy, happy baby. Praise the Lord! We're working on some new kiddo videos and hope to post those soon. So for now, I'll keep this short and defer to a later post on family stuff.
