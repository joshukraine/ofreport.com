  I recently made a two-week solo trip to the US to visit and support my family
  as my Mom is treated for multiple myloma cancer. We enjoyed many sweet moments
  together, including this Sunday morning hymn sing.

Mom was diagnosed with multiple myeloma cancer in 2020, and since that time our
lives have been different. There are days when things seem normal, and there are
battles that are dark and scary. Mom is a courageous fighter, and Dad along with
our siblings and their spouses have worked tirelessly to support her.

Now, Mom is facing new challenges with her health that represent a much steeper
decline than we have previously seen. Treatments that once seemed promising are
no longer effective. There is an urgency now that we have not felt before. We
are circling the wagons, as it were, to support her in every way we can.

God's healing hand is not shortened, and He knows the number of Mom's days.
Still, given all that has transpired, we believe that now is the time to gather.
We pray that God will give her years more of life, but if days or weeks are what
we have, we want to spend them well. Together with our Mom. Together as a
family.

At time of writing, Kelsie and I and our children are still in Ukraine, but we
are packing our bags to take the whole family to Texas. On Monday, we depart
Ukraine, and by Wednesday we will be in Fort Worth.

Please pray for Mom. Pray for the peace that passes understanding and for
healing. God is able to work miracles, but regardless of His answer, we trust
Him and we are so grateful for the years He has given with Mom.

## How You Can Pray

- Pray that God would heal Mom and give her more years of life with us. I'm
  praying for 15. It worked for Hezekiah! üòÅüôè
- Pray for our family as we travel by van across four countries just to reach
  our departure airport. (Ukraine &rarr; Poland &rarr; Slovakia &rarr; Austria)
  We fly out of Vienna on Wednesday morning.
- Pray for our children as they adjust to a new culture and new experiences, not
  to mention fighting jet lag.
- Praise God for the many generous saints who have already stepped up to help
  our family with logistics like housing and a vehicle. We are so grateful for
  the body of Christ!
- Praise God for our friend Matej in Slovakia who has offered to park our blue
  van for free for the entire time we are in the States!
