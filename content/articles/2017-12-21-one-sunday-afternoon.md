  The Bible First Kids class I lead at our church continues to be one of the ministries I enjoy most. We focus on Scripture memory, Sword Drills, and of course reading through the Bible First lessons together. And we have fun doing it! The kids range in age from 10-year-olds up to 15 and 16-year-olds.

The [Bible First Kids class](/blog/2017-06-13-bible-first-kids/) I lead at our church continues to be one of the ministries I enjoy most. We focus on Scripture memory, Sword Drills, and of course reading through the [Bible First lessons](https://getbiblefirst.com/lessons/) together. And we have fun doing it! The kids range in age from 10-year-olds up to 15 and 16-year-olds.

This past Sunday, we did something new. Instead of our usual class, we gathered all the kids together, hopped in the [famous yellow van](https://youtu.be/m4Kul2Jn1fI), and drove back to our house. Once there, we kicked things off with an art contest and hot chocolate. Next came games, pizza, singing, and finally roasted marshmallows over the fireplace.

Pictures tell the story best, so scroll on down and enjoy the ride! We love these kids and we're thrilled to see them seeking Christ as they prepare for adulthood. Please pray with us that God will turn each of them into powerful "arrows" for His kingdom!

(When you have a narrow apartment entrance and a crowd of kids all bundled up, the transition can take some time.) Hot chocolate was also a big win!"/>

Just order a bunch of pizzas, present them to the kids in an awe-inspiring stack of floppy cardboard boxes, and then enjoy your hero status! ;) In addition to pizza, we were also very grateful to Margarita for providing a tasty side salad."/>

Most of these we sang in both English and Ukrainian. The Ukrainian kids all have English classes at school, and many of them understand quite a bit."/>

There were some tough questions, but the kids did a great job. In the end each team nominated their MVP for the final round of questions. First one to get a question wrong was out. Both kids did so well that we finally had to call a tie!"/>
