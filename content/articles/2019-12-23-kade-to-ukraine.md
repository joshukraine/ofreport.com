  It's been said before, but it's worth saying again and again: THE number one need we have on the mission field is for laborers. Money, computers, vehicles, groceries, buildings — all of that is needful and we praise God for it. But vehicles don't preach. Dollars alone can't win souls. God has entrusted the ministry of the Gospel to *people*.

It's been said before, but it's worth saying again and again: THE number one need we have on the mission field is for laborers. Money, computers, vehicles, groceries, buildings — all of that is needful and we praise God for it. But vehicles don't preach. Dollars alone can't win souls. God has entrusted the ministry of the Gospel to people. *"Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the **labourers are few**: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, **that he would send forth labourers into his harvest**." (Luke 10:2)*

Every year, as we prepare for our summer outreaches, we pray that God would send us laborers. And He does! They usually come for a few weeks, they minister with us, and then they go on to their next field. But this year, God did something special and called a young man to come back and serve alongside our team in Ukraine.

Kade Bloom already had his sights set on the mission field before he arrived last summer to take part in CMO 2019. We met him through ETO board member, Ben Sargent, because the two of them had been evangelizing together in Georgia and North Carolina. During our staff meetings, I kept hearing Kade's name come up with phrases like "top-shelf" and "A-team".

Sure enough, Kade proved himself to be a valuable team member during CMO. He was diligent, sober-minded, and genuinely excited about the work of the Lord. Toward the end of his time in Ukraine, Kade asked to sit down for a chat with Nathan and I. He explained how he felt God was calling him to serve as a missionary full-time, and that he would like to begin by joining our team here in L'viv. He was prepared to stay for at least a year, and longer if God so directed. We gave him the green light and the countdown began. Since then, Kade has kept in touch with us, and he's gotten all his affairs in order. He will be arriving in L'viv on January 3, 2020.

Meanwhile, we've been lining up some ministry opportunities for Kade. Less than a week after he lands, he will be helping us with an evangelistic English retreat hosted by a local church in L'viv. The week after that, he'll begin teaching a Bible study with the teens at our church, Greater Grace. And of course, he'll be studying Ukrainian language and spending as much time as possible with the Ukrainian people.

Kade has already been very active in evangelism in the U.S., in Peru, and of course, in Ukraine. He has shown himself to be a faithful man and a real missionary. We'd like to ask you to pray for Kade as he steps out on this new path. To learn more about Kade, including how you can support him financially, please visit his website:

## CMO 2020

It's that time of year again: preparations for CMO 2020 are underway! We've now posted the updated Application and Info Pack to the CMO web site, so be sure to check those out at [cmoproject.org](https://cmoproject.org/). The dates for this year's project are **June 17 – July 13**.

Already we have several young men expressing interest in the project, and space is limited. So if you or someone you know are interested in joining our team this summer, be sure to get in touch right away!

## Good and Evil Ministry

The new Ukrainian edition of *Good and Evil* continues to reach people with the message of the Gospel. In addition to a steady stream of individual requests via our web site (dobroizlo.com.ua), we also receive regular orders from other ministries that are using the books for outreach. *Good and Evil* is making its way into libraries, schools, orphanages and youth camps around the country. Below are some photos we received from a group near Odessa who are using *Good and Evil* in their youth camps.

## How You Can Pray

* Pray for Kade Bloom as he prepares to come to Ukraine and begin full-time ministry.
* Pray that God would raise up a strong team for CMO 2020, and that He would open doors to the Gospel.
* Pray for the various other ministries we have going, including *Good and Evil*, *Bible First*, and our new web app, Bible First Online.
* Pray for health and physical safety for our team here in L'viv. Lots of colds and flu right now!
* Pray for peace and liberty in Ukraine.
