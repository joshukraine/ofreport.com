Hey, Friends!

Last week we experienced the largest missile and drone attack on Ukraine since the beginning of the war, spending most of Saturday night/Sunday morning in our hallway. We are thankful for Godâ€™s protection; our area was not hit, though explosions could be heard throughout the night. After catching only a couple hours sleep, Joshua then delivered the Sunday morning sermon! Church carried on as normal, even though many members were up through the night.

The lighter shade of red indicates that an air alert has just begun, with an oblast turning darker as the alert progresses. According to the Ukrainian Air Force, Russia launched 477 drones and 67 missiles that night. ðŸ˜°" />

Joshua had the privilege of speaking twice to a church group from Poltava, one of Ukraineâ€™s eastern oblasts. They brought their youth to Lâ€™viv last week for some much-needed R&R at a nearby campground, and Josh was one of the event speakers. Poltava experiences regularâ€“ if not nightlyâ€“ air raids, and many hypersonic missiles have been launched in recent days at Kremenchuk, one of its big cities. While at the camp, Joshua heard stories of some of the traumatizing attacks these folks have been witness to.

We are constantly in contact with hurting people. Natallia Chepara, whom many of you have asked about, was at our house recently for several hours. She is doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances, still knowing nothing conclusive about her husband. Also recent, a single man in our church, Raymond, who serves faithfully in many ways, was suddenly taken off the street by recruiting officers. He was assigned to a brigade within 24 hours and is undergoing training for the next several months. Raymond has left a huge hole in everyoneâ€™s hearts, but we take courage from his strong testimony of faith in Godâ€™s plan.

In June, Joshua spoke several times to this group, including a two-part series called _Our Identity in Christ_." />

We are all well; the kids are enjoying summer activities. Thank you for praying for us and for the people of Ukraine!
