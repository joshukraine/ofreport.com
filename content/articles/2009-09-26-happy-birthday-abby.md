We would like to thank all of our family and friends who sent gifts and greetings to Abigail on her birthday. We appreciate so much your part in her life. Please pray that God will continue to guide us and give wisdom from above as we train Abigail up in the ways of the Lord.

### Other Abby News

For the past year or more, Abby has shown a keen interest in music. She has demonstrated her talent by teaching herself to play familiar melodies on the piano. Songs she hears on her CD player during room time inevitably get plinked out on the piano later. Abby has also shown great interest in Kelsie's violin. So, a couple of weeks ago, we bought her a small beginner's violin. Abby was thrilled, and is already learning to play some songs with Mommy.
