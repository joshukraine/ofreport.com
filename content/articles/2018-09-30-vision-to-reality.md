For some of our readers, the completion of *Good and Evil* in Ukrainian may already be old news. 5,000 books were delivered to our office in L'viv on August 23rd, and shortly thereafter we published an announcement on the ETO blog. ([You can read that here.](https://euroteamoutreach.org/blog/2018/08/delivered/){: target="_blank"}) But as you may have guessed, there is more to tell.

This printing of *Good and Evil* is the fulfillment of a vision that began in 2016 when we realized that we would soon run out of books from our first print run (done in black and white). When we made the decision to print a new edition in color, we were not at all sure that we would be able to pull it off. Print runs like this cost thousands of dollars, to say nothing of the time and work involved with translation, graphics, editing, and so forth. As so often happens, God provided all that was needed, and now the new color edition of *Good and Evil* in Ukrainian is being shipped to families all across the nation.

On July 5, just before CMO began, we launched a new Ukrainian-language web site where people can go to request a free copy of the book. (Check out [dobroizlo.com.ua](https://dobroizlo.com.ua/){: target="_blank"} if you're curious.) As of this writing, we've received 191 requests ‚Äî an average of over two requests every day!

All this means a lot of work in the mail room for our team member, Denise Hutchison. In addition to all her work sending and receiving *Bible First* lessons, she's now shipping out dozens of *Good and Evil* books. Since their delivery in August, we've sent between 50-60 books, and more are in the pipeline!

I recently gave a copy of Good and Evil to every family represented in my Bible First Kids class. The first story we read together was the account of Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus about the brass serpent. Good and Evil includes both the New Testament account in John 3, and the corresponding Old Testament story of the brass serpent in Numbers. We read both and then discussed the correlation between them.

### Our Trip to America

We're here! After a long, but otherwise smooth series of flights, our family landed in Houston on September 1. We were greeted with warm smiles and hugs from Kelsie's folks who kindly picked us up at the airport. For the past few weeks, we've been enjoying a sweet time of fellowship in their home.

As I write this report, we are just days away from our [Big East Road Trip](https://ofreport.com/2018/02/coming-to-america/){: target="_blank"}, during which we'll visit the Ark Encounter and Creation Museum in Kentucky. We also plan to see several other people along our route, and then head to Family Camp in Big Sandy. After Family Camp, we'll transition up to Fort Worth to visit my family. We'll be returning to Ukraine in mid-December, just before the Christmas holidays.

Time in the US is always refreshing but at the same time a challenge. The little ones especially struggle with the changes and lack of routine. Everything is new and different from the world they're used to in Ukraine. Just the other day, after spending some time at a playground here in Houston, Kathryn came up to me and proclaimed excitedly, ‚ÄúDaddy, I met a little girl at the playground and she spoke to me in English!‚Äù üòÅ Please pray that God would give strength and rest as we try to make the most of our time here.

One of the highlights of our trip so far was our visit with the Villenueve family. Ralph Villenueve came to Ukraine in the summer of 2017, and he's been working with our ministry remotely ever since! The Villenueves are from Quebec, and they drove down to Houston to meet us last week. Stay tuned for more news about this amazing family in future posts.

### CMO 2018 Recap

After taking a season off in 2017, CMO came back with a bang in 2018! There's a lot to tell ‚Äî more than we have room for here. We had an outstanding team of men, and God blessed the advancement of His Gospel. If you'd like to learn more, please check out my recent post over on ETO's blog: [CMO 2018 Recap](https://euroteamoutreach.org/blog/2018/09/cmo-recap){: target="_blank"}.
