The journey that we began four months ago in Ukraine ended today in a quiet family birthing room in Houston. Our day started at 5am when we checked in to Hermann Memorial Hospital and Kelsie was given her initial dose of induction medication.

As anticipated, the first several hours were fairly uneventful, but as time passed the contractions increased their intensity. While labor is never easy, God gave much grace and Kelsie came through with flying colors. Kelsie's mom, Cindy, was with us along with our amazing medical staff - Dr. Berryhill and his nurse Ruth.

Our baby girl was born without incident at 3:37pm. She was 9 inches long and weighed 1 lbs. 8 oz. There were many tears mingled with words of comfort and relief. When everything was over, we all gathered around the bed, and I held Kelsie’s hand as we said a final prayer to the Lord, thanking Him for His gift of life and affirming our trust in His providence.

To all of you who have prayed for us, thank you. Words are inadequate to convey our gratefulness to the multitudes of God’s saints who have stood by us during this trial. We love you and we pray God’s richest blessings upon you for the kindness you have shown to us.

This has been a sad chapter in our lives, and yet we rejoice that the story does not end here. Jesus Christ has conquered death and because He lives, we will meet our daughter again.

Farewell, Little One. Be at peace in the glory of His presence and know that Mommy and Daddy love you. Wait a little while, and we’ll be home.
