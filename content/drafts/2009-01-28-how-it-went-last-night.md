As Mondays come around each week, we begin preparing for English Club and ABS. Sometimes it's not without an inward sigh, especially considering other all-consuming to-do's that have to be set aside. And then Tuesday night rolls around and we come home blessed, encouraged, and excited. READMORE It is so great to be a part of what God is doing in the lives of these people. We are truly coming to love and appreciate each member of our group, and pray that they will know Christ!

Marian, came to Joshua after the teaching last night and asked many sincere questions. Joshua said they could have talked for hours about things from God's Word. Unlike those whose hearts are hardened, who ask questions in order to debate, argue, or prove someone wrong, Marian seems to have a real desire to know truth.

Thank you to so much to all of you who are praying for this ministry and these people! We value those prayers and are encouraged to know that we're not in this alone. Prayer is half the battle--maybe even more.
