### Correspondence Bible Course

In other news, Bryan has been getting involved right away in helping with the Correspondence Bible Course. The areas he is able to cover have been a tremendous help to Joshua and I in keeping up with the course.

Every week when we visit the P.O. box, there is a stack of lessons waiting to be graded. Many students are asking questions related to the Bible. In addition, Joshua is working on some upgrades to our Course Database System that tracks the progress of each of our students. We feel both blessed and overwhelmed by the amount of work to do. Please pray that we would have wisdom and be faithful to the ministry God has given us!
