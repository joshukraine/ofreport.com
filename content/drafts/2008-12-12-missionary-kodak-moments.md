The microphone you see clipped on Joshua is not for voice projection, it's for recording. Each preaching session is recorded on CD for distribution to other Ukrainians, many of whom we may never meet personally.

P.S. Wanted: Prayer Warriors! On our way home from this last meeting, Joshua and I were discussing how neat it would be if people in America would stop to pray just as we were beginning each Tuesday night session. We are seeing God's blessing on this ministry and would love to have the prayers of the saints behind it. Our desire is that individuals would completely set aside what they're doing, even for five minutes or so, and pray for the salvation of these souls, every Tuesday at 11:00 am central. (Ukraine is 8 hours ahead, so you would be praying exactly at the time we are starting our evening meeting.) If you would be willing to participate in prayer for us consistently in this way, please <a href="http://www.OFReport.com/contact/">send us an e-mail</a> and let us know. We would be encouraged!
